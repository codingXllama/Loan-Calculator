<div class="container">
// a container in bootstrap adds margin to the middle, and margin auto (so we can have margins on the sides)
</div>


class="btn btn-dark btn-block"
Meaning: in bootstrap, btn-dark means making the button dark
                       btn-block means making the button go as wide as the UI 



In bootstrap to create an alert, you must give the class alert and alert-danger.
The alert-danger class will make the alert be red.
